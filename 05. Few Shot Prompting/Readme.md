# 🧠 Few-Shot Prompting with LangChain + OpenAI

This example demonstrates how to implement few-shot prompting with LangChain and OpenAI

*Few-shot prompting improves model reliability by grounding the LLM with curated Q&A examples. Instead of relying on zero-shot guesses, we explicitly teach the model a pattern — leading to more accurate and consistent responses.*

## ✨ Key Highlights

*  🔐 Secure API key handling with .env

* 📚 Structured dataset of Q&A examples

*  🏗️ Few-shot prompt construction via FewShotPromptTemplate

*  🤖 LLM integration with ChatOpenAI (gpt-4o-mini)

*  🔗 Prompt chaining using LangChain’s operator syntax

## 📦 Installation
```bash
pip install python-dotenv langchain-core langchain-openai
```

## Set your OpenAI API key in a .env file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## 🛠️ How It Works

*  Curated Examples → Encode domain knowledge into structured Q&A pairs.

* Few-Shot Template → Formats those examples into a single coherent prompt.

* LLM Integration → Send prompt + new input question to OpenAI’s chat model.

* Chaining → Use LangChain’s operator (|) to seamlessly pipe prompts into the model.


## 🌍 Why This Matters

* Few-shot prompting is the backbone of robust LLM apps:

* Helps control output format

* Reduces hallucination risk

* Makes responses predictable in production pipelines

If you’re building chatbots, retrieval systems, or domain-specific assistants, this is a foundational pattern to master.


## 🔮 Next Steps

* Swap gpt-4o-mini with larger/faster models

* Dynamically generate examples from a dataset

* Pair with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enterprise-scale apps
