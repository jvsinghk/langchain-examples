# Hugging Face with LangChain Example

This project demonstrates how to use a Hugging Face model (`crumb/nano-mistral`) with LangChain via the `langchain-huggingface` integration. The example uses a simple text generation pipeline.

## Installation

First, clone the repository or copy the script. Then install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install the dependencies manually:

```bash
pip install langchain-huggingface
pip install transformers
pip install torch
```

Usage

Run the script with:

```bash
python huggingface.py
```


This will invoke the Hugging Face model and print the generated output.

Example Output

Hugging Face is amazing for AI and NLP!


(Output will vary depending on the model response.)
